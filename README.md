## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

After getting all resources from client and agreeing to the design, I started with HTML for content and structure, CSS for rwd, beautiful color palettes & elegant layouts. After that, JS to add some functionality & interaction. 


## Optimizations

Will update new photos, change some colors in main.css and create a new "Meet Our Barbers" section in the menu.
